View the live project [here](https://couch-co-op-db.herokuapp.com/).

Couch Co-Op DB is a website for people that enjoy playing couch co-op videogames. The idea for this project is to create a space where players can become registered users and add their favourite games, share tips and tricks and rate them. Site visitors can read about the games and purchase them via a hyperlink to Steam that will provide them with a 20% discount voucher.

The wireframes for the website have been created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and are available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Z4haTyThhzKwdy75zFupo5/Couch-Co-Op-DB?node-id=0%3A1).
Tablet and mobile devices share the same layout, while a separate design has been created for the desktop views.

## Features

### Existing Features
The **features** on the website will:
- Allow site visitor to register a user account and access more functionalities, such as: add, comment and mark games as favourite.
- Display all couch co-op games that the community has added to enable visitors to read all the details and comments sharing tips and tricks.
- Provide a direct shopping link for each game to the Steam store, where they can get a 20% discount voucher when purchasing it.

I achieve this by:

- Providing registration and user authentication for users to create an account and see their account details.
- Enabling users to add new games and edit their entries. 
- Linking the game store to each game directly on the website.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Create a dashboard to provide site visitors with statistics about all the games.
- Implement a star rating functionality that allows the users to upvote and downvote games depending on their preferences.

## Deployment

### Heroku 

This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://couch-co-op-db.herokuapp.com/) and has been deployed by following the next steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file that collects all required dependencies, by typing in the CLI `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
2. Create a Procfile for Heroku by typing in the CLI: `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Delete blank line at the bottom of the Procfile to avoid problems when running the app on Heroku.
3. Push both the requirements.txt and Procfile to GitHub.
4. Log in to Heroku and click on "Create new app". Choose a unique name and use "dash" or "minus" instead of spaces and all lowercase letters. Select the region closest to you and click "Create app".
5. Within the app in Heroku, navigate to the "Deploy" tab and, under "Deployment method", click GitHub. 
6. Search for the repository name and, once it finds it, click "Connect" to connect the app.
7. Next, navigate to the "Settings" tab and click on "Reveal Config Vars". Here, the variables stored in the env.py file need to be entered:
    - IP: value of 0.0.0.0.
    - PORT: value of 5000
    - SECRET_KEY
    - MONGO_URI
    - MONGO_DBNAME: the value is the name of the database
8. Finally, back to the "Deploy" tab, under "Automatic deploys", select "Enable Automatic Deploys" and click "Deploy Branch".
9. The app is built and once it's done, a message will display "Your app was successfully deployed", then you can click View to launch it.

### Locally

You can clone this project and run it locally, by following the next steps:
1. Clone this project's repo from [here](https://github.com/MihaelaVacarus/Couch-Co-Op-DB) by clicking on "Code" and copying `gh repo clone MihaelaVacarus/Couch-Co-Op-DB`.
2. Open your IDE and paste it in the terminal. 
3. Install the modules listed in the requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the CLI.
4. In MongoDB, create a database called "couchCoOpDB" and replicate the collections specified in the [database section](#database).
5. In the root directory of your project, create an env.py file and remember to add it to your .gitignore file. The content of this env.py file will be:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "[YOUR SECRET KEY]")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://[YOUR ROOT]@cluster0.fw1gk.mongodb.net/couchCoOpDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DNNAME", "couchCoOpDB")
````

You will need to enter your own SECRET_KEY and ROOT info.

6. You can now run the app locally by typing `python3 app.py` in the CLI and open it in your browser.
