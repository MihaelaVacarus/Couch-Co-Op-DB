# Couch Co-Op DB
![WebsiteSnapshot](static/images/website-snapshot.png)
View the live project [here](https://couch-co-op-db.herokuapp.com/).

Couch Co-Op DB is a website for people that enjoy playing couch co-op videogames. The idea for this project is to create a space where players can become registered users and add their favourite games, share tips and tricks and rate them. Site visitors can read about the games and purchase them via a hyperlink to Steam that will provide them with a 20% discount voucher.

## UX (User Experience) ##

### **Project Goals** ###

The **goal** of this project is to build a website that allows people passionate about videogames to find the most played couch co-op games added by registered users, read comments from the community and get a direct link to purchase the games with a discount voucher.

### **User Stories** ###
#### **New Site Visitor** ####
- As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate to the different site pages.
- As a user, I want to see a page containing all games.
- As a user, I want to be able to register on the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to add new games and add comments.
- As a user, I want to be able to read other memberâ€™s reviews.
- As a user, I want to be able to search the site by games names, number of players and platform.
- As a user, I want to be able to find direct links to purchase the games I like.

#### **Returning Site Visitor** ####
- As a user, I want to see my user account profile page.
- As a user, I want to be able to update and/or delete any of the games I have added.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark games as favorites, so I can easily see them from my account page. 
- As a user, I want to be able to leave comments on the other games.

#### **Site Administrator** ####
- As an **Administrator**, I want to be able to add, edit and delete the games details.

### **Site Owner Goals** ###
- Create a co-op gaming community to increase site owner's following on Twitch and rest of social media. 
- Earn money every time a user purchases a game via the link provided on my site.
 

### **Design** ###

#### **Wireframes** ####
The wireframes for the website have been created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and are available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Z4haTyThhzKwdy75zFupo5/Couch-Co-Op-DB?node-id=0%3A1).
Tablet and mobile devices share the same layout, while a separate design has been created for the desktop views. 

While working on the project, I made some small adjustments to the original wireframes:
- On the **Home** page, the order of the menu has been changed to **Games Sign Up Sign In** instead of **Games Already a member? Sign In Sign Up**.
- The Admin UI has been simplified and instead of having another tab called **Manage Games**, the Admin user has been granted rights to edit and/or delete any games, regardless by whom these have been added. This made more sense to keep the design cleaner.
- For each game's page, the mark as favourite and shopping link buttons have been placed to the left instead, and the comment functionality button has been renamed to **POST**. 
- For both pages of legal content, ToU and Privacy Policy, a scrollspy has been added to improve the UX.

The color scheme is based on the colours of the *Moving Out* videogame and generated through the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
To keep it simple and relatable to the videogames, a two colors palette has been used, see [here](https://coolors.co/f7ba2e-db3549).

## Features

### Existing Features
The **features** on the website will:
- Allow site visitor to register a user account and access more functionalities, such as: add, comment and mark games as favourite.
- Display all couch co-op games that the community has added to enable visitors to read all the details and comments sharing tips and tricks.
- Provide a direct shopping link for each game to the Steam store, where they can get a 20% discount voucher when purchasing it.

I achieve this by:

- Providing registration and user authentication for users to create an account and see their account details.
- Enabling users to add new games and edit their entries. 
- Linking the game store to each game directly on the website.

#### Security Features
- Defensive programming to prevente brute force access to unauthorized pages, only available for registered visitors. 
- Verification of the username, preventing visitors to register more than one profile per username.
- Username and password validation before logging in.
- Form validation for input fields.
- Enable **only** users that posted a specific game to also edit and delete it.
- Reserve the rights to edit and delete to Admin user as well, so the website can be managed.
- If a user clicks Delete game by mistake, a modal is shown to request the user to confirm deletion or cancel the action.
- Buttons reserved for registered visitors are hidden from unregistered guests.
- Verification if a user has already marked a game as favourite to prevent from adding the same game multiple times.
- Error handlers to explain 404, 500 and 503 error types to visitors and redirect them to another place on the website.

### Features Left to Implement
- Create a dashboard to provide site visitors with statistics about all the games.
- Implement a star rating functionality that allows the users to upvote and downvote games depending on their preferences.
- Add additional functionalities to allow users to remove a game from favourites, and edit and/or delete their own comments.

## Deployment

### Heroku 

This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://couch-co-op-db.herokuapp.com/) and has been deployed by following the next steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file that collects all required dependencies, by typing in the CLI `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
2. Create a Procfile for Heroku by typing in the CLI: `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Delete blank line at the bottom of the Procfile to avoid problems when running the app on Heroku.
3. Push both the requirements.txt and Procfile to GitHub.
4. Log in to Heroku and click on "Create new app". Choose a unique name and use "dash" or "minus" instead of spaces and all lowercase letters. Select the region closest to you and click "Create app".
5. Within the app in Heroku, navigate to the "Deploy" tab and, under "Deployment method", click GitHub. 
6. Search for the repository name and, once it finds it, click "Connect" to connect the app.
7. Next, navigate to the "Settings" tab and click on "Reveal Config Vars". Here, the variables stored in the env.py file need to be entered:
    - IP: value of 0.0.0.0.
    - PORT: value of 5000
    - SECRET_KEY
    - MONGO_URI
    - MONGO_DBNAME: the value is the name of the database
8. Finally, back to the "Deploy" tab, under "Automatic deploys", select "Enable Automatic Deploys" and click "Deploy Branch".
9. The app is built and once it's done, a message will display "Your app was successfully deployed", then you can click View to launch it.

### Locally

You can clone this project and run it locally, by following the next steps:
1. Clone this project's repo from [here](https://github.com/MihaelaVacarus/Couch-Co-Op-DB) by clicking on "Code" and copying `gh repo clone MihaelaVacarus/Couch-Co-Op-DB`.
2. Open your IDE and paste it in the terminal. 
3. Install the modules listed in the requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the CLI.
4. In MongoDB, create a database called "couchCoOpDB" and replicate the collections specified in the [database section](#database).
5. In the root directory of your project, create an env.py file and remember to add it to your .gitignore file. The content of this env.py file will be:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "[YOUR SECRET KEY]")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "[YOUR MONGO URI"])
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "couchCoOpDB")
````

You will need to enter your own SECRET_KEY and MONGO_URI info.

6. You can now run the app locally by typing `python3 app.py` in the CLI and open it in your browser.
