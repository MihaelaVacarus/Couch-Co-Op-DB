# Couch Co-Op DB

Couch Co-Op DB is a website for people that enjoy playing couch co-op videogames. The idea for this project is to create a space where players can become registered users and add their favourite games, share tips and tricks and rate them. Site visitors can read about the games and purchase them via a hyperlink to Steam that will provide them with a 20% discount voucher.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
The **features** on the website will:
- Allow site visitor to register a user account and access more functionalities, such as: add, comment and mark games as favourite.
- Display all couch co-op games that the community has added to enable visitors to read all the details and comments sharing tips and tricks.
- Provide a direct shopping link for each game to the Steam store, where they can get a 20% discount voucher when purchasing it.

I achieve this by:

- Providing registration and user authentication for users to create an account and see their account details.
- Enabling users to add new games and edit their entries. 
- Linking the game store to each game directly on the website.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Create a dashboard to provide site visitors with statistics about all the games.
- Implement a star rating functionality that allows the users to upvote and downvote games depending on their preferences.
